This repository contains data and central python codes for Doanet et al., 2022, "Hillslope Roughness Reveals Forest Sensitivity to Extreme Winds". 

Python Codes:
1. Doane2022_ExtremeValueFitResist.py is a python script that iteratively changes the overlap between probability distributions of driving forces and resisting forces. 
2. Doane2022_hourlyGustDist.py is a python script that develops the conditional distribution of strongest 3-second gust and hourly gust speeds. THen It develops the extreme value distribution of gust speeds. 

Data: 
1. MMGust.npy is a numpy array of 3 second gusts over two years.
2. MMhourly.npy is a numpy array of hourly averaged wind speed over these two years. 
3. MorganMonroeWind.csv is hourly averaged wind speed data over 20 years.
4. varVals.npy is an array of values that are the bin edges for the pdf of topographic variance values
5. pdfZVar.npy is a numpy array of the probability density for topographic roughness values.
